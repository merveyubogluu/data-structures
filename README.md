# Data Structures Implementation with C

You can find basic implementations of some certain data algorithms in C language. I write these codes to understand the basics, so there might be issues. 

## Running the Code

I use VS Code to run and debug my C codes. My suggestion is set up the following debugger to your VS Code and then learn how to debug. Because most of the time, you will get errors like segmentation fault. With this debugger, you can see what's wrong with your code. I strongly recommend that debugger.
